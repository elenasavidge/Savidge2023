# Savidge2023
Code to reproduce figures in Savidge et al., 2023.

Must begin with running step0.ipynb notebook to process seal data into format used for subsequent notebooks for all figures from the main text (i.e., figs 1-8). Step0.ipynb will save data files as pickle files which then can easily be read in the fig notebooks.

Note: fig. 6 notebook requires to be run after fig. 5 notebook to read in proper data ('meltwaterXXarray_file'). Otherwise, notebooks do not depend on each other.
